<h1>HTML & CSS samples</h1>

<p>This respository contains folders for four samples sites. Folder names include some of what can be found on the sites <br>
(i.e. forms, Javascript, various assets, image mapping). Assets are included in the folders.

Most CSS is coded into the head of the index. HTML_CSS_video-gif-music-iframe is the exception and contains a stylesheet link.
The stylesheet can also be found in the folder.</p>

<p>View the sample site from the HTML_CSS_window.open-image-mapping folder <a href="https://sibineejokela.github.io/nutrition_sample_website/">using this link.</a></p>
